## Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL

Question 1: Which Products Should We Order More of or Less of?
To answer this question, I'll have to look at the inventory reports, including low stock and product performance. 
The highest-performance products are the classic cars thus, they should be the priority for restocking. 

Question 2: How should we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
Such strategies should consider driving loyalty and attracting more customers depending on the type of customers.
